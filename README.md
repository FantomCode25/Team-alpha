### ‚ùó Problem Statement
#### The Challenge of Building Full-Stack Apps Today
Modern app development faces several hurdles:

- **Fragmented Codebases:** Developers juggle multiple languages and frameworks, often leading to inconsistent code quality.
- **High Development Costs & Time:** Manual integration, debugging, and cross-platform testing slow down time-to-market.
- **Limited Customization:** Existing tools often require steep learning curves or fail to offer fully customizable, production-ready solutions.
- **Market Gaps:** Platforms like *lovable.dev* and *Bolt AI* exist but are limited by rigid codebases or incomplete end-to-end automation.

### üß© Architecture
AppGenesis AI is built on a modular architecture for scalability, maintainability, and seamless code generation. Key components include:

- **User Interface:**  
  A React-based frontend (powered by Next.js) where users input app ideas and select frontend languages (Kotlin, Swift, or Flutter).
- **Backend Server:**  
  Built with Next.js and TypeScript, it processes user requests and communicates with the AI layer.
- **AI Processing Layer:**  
  Leverages LangFlow to orchestrate AI agents that interpret user input and generate code.
- **Code Generation Modules:**  
  Dedicated components produce frontend code (in the chosen language) and backend code.
- **Integration & Testing:**  
  Automatically integrates and tests the generated code for functionality.
- **Output Delivery:**  
  Presents the final code to the user through the web interface.
